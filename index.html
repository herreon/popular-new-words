                Language is constantly evolving. In this age where memes, hashtags and video bites communicate every thought and experience,
                using new lingo isn't just lit, it's indispensable. What were the most popular new words of 2019?

                    To identify 2019's rising words, I used Google Trends to rank Search Interest growth for definitions of words 
                    (for example, searches for "meaning of vsco", "what does ok boomer mean").

                    In 2019, these 9 words were the top new darlings in colloquialism 
                    SFS, VSCO, SB, NGL, S/U, FYP, IYKYK, simp, and ok boomer. 
                    From the end of 2018 to June 2019, SFS led the pack by a significant margin, followed by VSCO, SB and NGL.

                    Soon after June, VSCO surged in search interest, reaching peak popularity in September.

                    In the final quarter, ok boomer outstripped all other new words, suggesting a rapid uptick in adoption. 
                    Interest dwindled somewhat after January 2020, but remained the most popular search by far.

                    Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a material paradigm of consensus
                    that includes consciousness as a totality. Lacan uses the term ‘predialectic
